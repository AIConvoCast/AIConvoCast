# Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated Google Cloud Text-to-Speech with Chirp 3 HD voices into the AI podcast pipeline. The integration allows users to use the new `GV1` workflow pattern to generate audio using Google's high-quality Chirp 3 HD voices instead of ElevenLabs.

## Features Added

### 1. Google TTS Client Configuration
- ✅ Added Google Cloud Text-to-Speech import
- ✅ Configured client initialization using existing service account (`jmio-google-api.json`)
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing/invalid credentials

### 2. Google Voice Audio Generation Function
- ✅ Created `generate_google_voice_audio()` function
- ✅ Created `_generate_single_google_chunk()` helper function
- ✅ Support for text chunking (4000 character limit per chunk)
- ✅ Audio merging for multi-chunk texts
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Voice Mapping System
- ✅ Complete mapping of all 30 Chirp 3 HD voices
- ✅ Easy-to-use voice ID system (GV1 = Alnilam, GV2 = Achernar, etc.)
- ✅ Support for both male and female voices

### 4. Workflow Pattern Integration
- ✅ Added regex pattern recognition for `GV(\d+)L(\d+)SL(\d+)(?:T(\d+))?`
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing workflow system
- ✅ Support for custom titles and location management
- ✅ Proper error handling and workflow step logging

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (`test_google_voice.py`)
- ✅ Automated validation of imports, client initialization, and patterns
- ✅ Ready for API testing once enabled

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
To use Google Voice in your workflow, use the pattern: `L8GV1SL4`

Where:
- `L8` = Source location ID 8 (where to get the text file)
- `GV1` = Google Voice ID 1 (Alnilam voice)
- `SL4` = Save location ID 4 (where to save the audio)

### Advanced Usage with Custom Title
To use a custom title from a previous response: `L8GV1SL4T2`

Where:
- `T2` = Use response 2 as the title for the generated audio file

## Available Google Voices

|----------|------------|--------|---------------|
| GV1 | Alnilam | Male | `L8GV1SL4` |
| GV2 | Achernar | Female | `L8GV2SL4` |
| GV3 | Achird | Male | `L8GV3SL4` |
| GV4 | Algenib | Male | `L8GV4SL4` |
| GV5 | Algieba | Male | `L8GV5SL4` |
| GV6 | Aoede | Female | `L8GV6SL4` |
| GV7 | Autonoe | Female | `L8GV7SL4` |

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

1. **Import Added** (Line 28):
   ```python
   from google.cloud import texttospeech
   ```

2. **Client Initialization** (Lines 275-281):
   ```python
   try:
       google_tts_client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient.from_service_account_json(GOOGLE_TTS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE)
       print(f"✅ Google Text-to-Speech client configured")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"⚠️ Google Text-to-Speech client initialization failed: {e}")
       google_tts_client = None
   ```

3. **Voice Generation Functions** (Lines 1759-1902):
   - `generate_google_voice_audio()` - Main function
   - `_generate_single_google_chunk()` - Helper for single chunks

4. **Workflow Integration** (Lines 2801-2968):
   - Pattern matching for Google Voice steps (`L(\d+)GV(\d+)SL(\d+)(?:T(\d+))?`)
   - Voice ID mapping
   - File handling and upload logic

### Key Features

- **Chunking Support**: Automatically splits long texts into 4000-character chunks
- **Audio Merging**: Seamlessly merges multiple chunks into single file
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **Voice Mapping**: Easy-to-remember voice IDs (GV1, GV2, etc.)
- **File Management**: Automatic temp file cleanup
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing workflow patterns

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Enable Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
**REQUIRED**: Enable the API in your Google Cloud project:
- Visit: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/texttospeech.googleapis.com/overview?project=467565497623
- Click "Enable API"
- Wait a few minutes for propagation

### 2. Service Account Permissions
Ensure your existing service account (`jmio-google-api.json`) has:
- Cloud Text-to-Speech API access
- Text-to-Speech Client role

### 3. Python Dependencies
Already installed:
- `google-cloud-texttospeech`

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
python test_google_voice.py
```

### Expected Results
Once API is enabled, all 5 tests should pass:
1. ✅ Import Test

| Pattern | `L8E1SL4` | `L8GV1SL4` |
| Voice Quality | High | High (Chirp 3 HD) |
| Voice Options | Custom voices | 30 Chirp 3 HD voices |
| Configuration | Requires Eleven sheet | Built-in voice mapping |
| Cost | Per character | Per character |
| Reliability | High | High (Google Cloud) |

## Next Steps

1. **Enable API**: Visit the Google Cloud Console to enable Text-to-Speech API
2. **Test Integration**: Run `python test_google_voice.py` to verify setup
3. **Update Workflows**: Start using `L8GV1SL4` patterns in your workflows
4. **Voice Selection**: Experiment with different voices (GV1-GV30) to find preferred options

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **API Not Enabled**: Follow the URL provided in error messages
2. **Permissions**: Verify service account has Text-to-Speech access
3. **Testing**: Use `test_google_voice.py` for troubleshooting
4. **Voice Selection**: Refer to voice mapping table above

## Conclusion

The Google Voice integration is now complete and ready for use. Once the Text-to-Speech API is enabled, users can seamlessly switch between ElevenLabs and Google Voice using simple workflow patterns, providing more flexibility and options for high-quality podcast audio generation.

**Note**: The pattern format is `L8GV1SL4` where the location comes first, then the Google Voice ID, then the save location.
